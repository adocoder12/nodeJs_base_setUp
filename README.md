# nodeJs base setUp

A robust starter template for building Node.js applications with TypeScript and Express. This project is designed to help you kickstart your Node.js projects with best practices, modular architecture, and built-in configurations for development and production environments.

## Features

TypeScript & Express: A modern setup using TypeScript for type safety and Express for the web framework.
Modular Architecture: Organized folder structure for controllers, routes, middleware, and types.
Custom Error Handling: Built-in custom error class and centralized error-handling middleware.
Security Best Practices: Integration of Helmet and other middleware to enhance security.
Environment Configuration: Support for environment variables with a sample .env file.
Linting & Formatting: Pre-configured ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style.
Scalable & Maintainable: A clear project structure that’s easy to expand and maintain.
Prerequisites

Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
npm Installation

## Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/adocoder12/nodeJs_base_setUp.git
cd nodeJs_base_setUp

## Install dependencies:

npm install
Set up Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the project root (or copy from .env.example if provided) and configure your environment settings. For example:
PORT=8080
NODE_ENV=development
Usage

# Start the Development Server:

npm run dev
The server will start on http://localhost:8080 by default. You can change the port by updating your .env file.
Build for Production:
npm run build
npm start
