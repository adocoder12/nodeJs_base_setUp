# nodeJs base setUp

A robust starter template for building Node.js applications with TypeScript and Express. This project is designed to help you kickstart your Node.js projects with best practices, modular architecture, and built-in configurations for development and production environments.

## Features

- TypeScript & Express: A modern setup using TypeScript for type safety and Express for the web framework.
- Modular Architecture: Organized folder structure for controllers, routes, middleware, and types.
- Custom Error Handling: Built-in custom error class and centralized error-handling middleware.
- Security Best Practices: Integration of Helmet and other middleware to enhance security.
- Environment Configuration: Support for environment variables with a sample .env file.
- Scalable & Maintainable: A clear project structure that’s easy to expand and maintain.
